### System Design for AnonyNet Proxy Server

#### 1. **System Overview**
AnonyNet is a proxy server designed to anonymize user requests by routing them through random public proxies. It consists of several key components: a web server, a proxy management module, a request handler, and a logging system.

#### 2. **Components and Architecture**

##### **2.1. Web Server**
- **Technology**: Flask (Python)
- **Purpose**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate components.

##### **2.2. Proxy Management Module**
- **Purpose**: Manages a list of public proxies and selects a random proxy for each request.
- **Data**: List of proxies (IP address and port).
- **Configuration**: Can be updated dynamically to add or remove proxies.

##### **2.3. Request Handler**
- **Purpose**: Forwards the incoming requests to the target server through a selected proxy and returns the response to the user.
- **Functionality**: Supports both GET and POST requests.

##### **2.4. Logging System**
- **Purpose**: Records request and response details for monitoring and debugging purposes.
- **Features**: Logs IP addresses, request URLs, response status codes, and errors.

#### 4. **Detailed Workflow**

1. **User Request**: A user sends an HTTP request to the AnonyNet server.
2. **Proxy Selection**: The web server forwards the request to the Proxy Management Module, which selects a random proxy from its list.
3. **Request Forwarding**: The Request Handler forwards the user’s request to the target server through the selected proxy.
4. **Response Handling**: The target server responds to AnonyNet, which then sends the response back to the user.
5. **Logging**: The Logging System records details about the request and response.

#### 5. **Security Considerations**

- **Data Encryption**: Use HTTPS to encrypt data between the user and the AnonyNet server.
- **Proxy Security**: Ensure that public proxies used are reliable and secure. Avoid using proxies that could compromise user data.
- **Access Control**: Implement authentication mechanisms if needed to restrict access to the proxy server.

#### 6. **Deployment and Scalability**

- **Deployment**: Deploy the server on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean for high availability and scalability.
- **Scaling**: Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the proxy server if the user base grows.

#### 7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**

- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring tools to track server performance and proxy health.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update the list of proxies and ensure the system is patched against vulnerabilities.
